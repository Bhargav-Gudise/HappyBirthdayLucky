                It's incredible how much can change in just a year. Even though we met only a year ago, you’ve become so close to our heart. Your presence makes us feel like you’re one of us, and our bond feels so natural and strong. Our bond became even stronger when you tied rakhi to me. It made our connection feel even more special.
            </p>
            <p>You bring such positive vibes and warmth into our life, and I’ve always enjoy your company.</p>
            <p>On your special day, I wish you nothing but the best, filled with love, joy, and all the happiness in the world. May your year ahead be as wonderful as you are!
            </p>
            <p>Yours Funny Brother<br>Bhargav</p>
